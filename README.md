# Advanced Computer Architecture
ECE 6100, Fall 2019, Georgia Tech

### Course Overview
1. The course focuses on evolution of computer architecture and the factors influencing the design of hardware and software elements of computer systems. Topics covered until now: in-order and out-of-order superscalar architectures, instruction set design, processor micro-architecture and pipelining, cache organizations, and multithreaded architectures.  
2. This repo includes the lab programming assignments in C++ for this course. Through implementing different techniques in pipelining, the goal of the projects are to evaluate the performance (CPI, mis-prediction rate... etc) of the machine.
