# Dependency Tracking and Forwarding for 5-stage Superscalar Pipeline with Branch Prediction
1. Equip the code to check data dependencies in a pipeline, implement a forwarding path, and extend the pipeline to be an “N-wide” superscalar machine.  
```/src/pipeline.cpp```
2. The second part of the assignments deals with integrating a branch predictor with the superscalar pipeline.
```/src/bpred.cpp```
```/src/bpred.h```
